                  Here's my website...</h2>
      
      
      
     Basically, I really like traveling... and I wanted to build a website that I could add to if I ever felt compelled to do so. SO HERE IT IS. And also it's been super rainy the past few days so I didn't feel inspired so take many photos but over the last year, I traveled to a lot of awesome spots and I used images from those trips to create this web page. No one asked for my life story, but I'm going to give it anyways. <bR> <BR>
      
      Forward; I became very complacent and depressed after working at Chrysler for five years right out of high-school... so I quit. Making that decision was very long ended and difficult for me, because most of my family has worked there for their whole lives and I guess I didn't really know what else I would ever do with my life. Honestly, quitting was one of my best decisionsion, as I am not persuring a degree, I have a way easier, kick-ass job where I make the same amount of money. I saved a lot while I was working there and after I quit I had no clue what I would do... which resulted in me A) finding a love for traveling and B) finding a love for nature. <BR><br>
          I got really invested in hiking and backpacking, and I traveled to a lot of beautiful places around the U.S.
          <br>
 
Below is a photo that I took in Arizona, at Devil's Bridge.  Devil's Bridge I would rate as a medium difficulty hike that is out and back 4.2 miles. The hike leads to an amazing look out point of some beatiful red rocks in Sedona and a big rock formation that resembles a bridge. <BR> <BR>
      
      Initially, I went to Arizona because I had planned to hike Havasupai Falls and realized I was DRAMATICALL unprepared for that hike. Just getting there, I made a wrong turn which resulted in a 2 hour deturn down a dirt path. Sedona wasn't on my list of places to visit during that trip but I ended up spending several days there because I fell in love with it.
      
      <BR> <BR> 
I spent alot of time in California growing up, so I was use to seeing mountains but I had never seen mountains like the ones in Arizona before. The way the sun hits the red rocks is so breath taking. While I was in Sedona I learn about the Sedonda Vortices... yes, I am into spirtual woo-woo B.S..... metaphysics. 
Sedona is considered to have "vortex energy". Vortices are places where the earth seems especially alive with energy. Many people feel inspired, recharged or uplifted after visiting a vortex. If you've ever been to Sedona, I think it's hard to deny that you feel SOMETHING different energetically there. A traveled to a few other places like this last year, one being Mount Shasta, in Shasta County, CA.

     <p>Below, is a video I took on my first "long" back-packing trip. I went with a friend I've know since high school. This video is a little embarassing to include but it is the first "vlog" I made... I used only my photo to edit and shoot it and I had a lot of fun editing it.      
    <BR><BR> 
        The trail we hiked was Eagle Rock Loop in Ouchita National Forest... it's roughly a 30 mile trail where you actually hike 5 different mountain peaks. I didn't realize that before commiting to the hike it was one of the most difficult loop trails in the United States. I thought I was going to die several times during the hike... after I got home, I lost 4 differnt toe nails. Anyways.... just watch the video.

 <h2>Utah... and California. </h2> 
          
          <div class="angel" style="height:275px;"></div> <BR> 
        
        Utah is the coolest place I have ever been, hands down. I want to live there at some point in my life. I've looked into transfering to college there. Out of all the places I went in the past year, I was most excited for Utah. While I was there I spent most of my time in Zion National Park, which was amazing. I hiked the Narrows and Angel's Landing... both of them were so cool. THe photo above is my on top of Angels Landing... if you ever get a chance fricken go! <BR> <BR> 
          
        
        Below is a photo of a random beach along the highway in Monteray Bay. California holds a special place in my heart because I've been going there since I was an infant and my mom lived there my entire life, most of her family lives there as well. Last November I made a trip out to California and for the first time in my adult life, I drove the coast of Big Sur until I got to the road closing that resulted from the mud slide that happeend because of all the rain. Esentailly the cost of California is falling off. Big Sur is CRAZY!!! <br>
